# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

This is a guided, hands-on project from DataWithBaraa designed to build a modern data warehouse using SSMS. The goal is to learn progressively throughout the process, covering key concepts like ETL, data modeling, and analytics step by step.

# 🏗️ Data Architecture
Medallion Architecture 
   - Bronze Layer - Raw data, full bulk load from the csv files into table, not transformation
   - Silver Layer - Full load from bronze into table. Data is tranformed here.
   - Gold Layer - No load. Using the tranformed data to create business-ready data views

# 🛠️ Specifications
- Resources and Tools Used:
   - Data Sources: CSV files
   - Environment: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
   - Diagrams & Visuals: https://draw.io
   - Project Tracking & Notes: https://www.notion.so
   - Data Models: Star schema
   - Version Control: GitHub

# 📌 Key Learnings
  - I genuinely enjoyed working on this project — it helped me consolidate and apply the concepts I’ve been learning in a structured, hands-on way. One of the practical takeaways was the value of printing log messages during data loading, which made debugging and workflow tracking much clearer.

   This project also deepened my understanding of:
   - How to design and implement a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers)
   - What to look for when performing data transformations and ensuring data quality
   - The importance of clear data modeling and schema design (like Star Schema) for analytics
   - Structuring a data pipeline from raw ingestion to business-ready reporting
   - Overall, this experience improved both my technical skills and the way I think about data architecture and workflow management.
